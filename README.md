# Simple-Bank-system-

I built a simple bank system can handle Clients by CRUD operations , however, there is no database, but I used txt file to save the data for the project 
Also I included ATM simple system connected to the clients I have 
Also I included Transactions simple system between the clients

It's procedural programming NOT OOP so it's based on enums + structures (instead of using classes) + simple data structure as vectors.
